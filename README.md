Well it basically renders a cube in the console with syntaxes.

I wrote it from scratch and the logic is linear algebra.

Just now it renders a cube but code designed to render any object if the structer of the object is coded.
Now it is just corners and edges. I am working on filling the triangles than I will code the lighting part.
